# Lattice-Boltzmann-fluid-flow-in-Tensorflow
A Lattice Boltzmann fluid flow simulation written in Tensorflow. The flow library is contained in `LatFlow` and supports both 2D and 3D simulations. There are 3 test files to showcase different simulations that can be run (flow around a car, lid driven cavity and 3d simulation around a cube).

# Videos that it makes!
